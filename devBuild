//This is supposed to be the early game. If this is supposed to be the early game, then WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE THE FUN AND QUICK GRINDS? basically, every single thing in the game either needs a production buff or a price nerf. It’s supposed to be go from one thing to the next. Remember: this is the early game. It should be quick, and the number should go up fast. I thought about it, and…isn’t this stuff coming in the future updates? We got gold, chips, fame! Right now, what we have is the full game. It shouldn’t be a quick grind. (although I am buffing the game bug)
 
//the nerf list: should consider a nerf towards inflation for all towers...upgrades should be more extensive/cover a larger area of the game. glitch also deserves a nerf. Console upgrades could use a possible nerf. Ironically the tower based trophies also need a nerf. One of the outlining issues is when you start the game, you get all this crazy stuff. But then there’s this long stretch where there’s nothing stimulating. Then, near the end, it starts picking back up again.

//1.0 Changelog: FULL RELEASE BABY!!!! this game was like multiple months in the making, so enjoy!
 
//Credits (people who helped me get ideas for code for specific things)
//kasperja on Reddit for the controller level up visuals
//Davtalas on Reddit for the upgrade filter idea, and the actual code for it
 
//from now on, use this:#b09b00 for the gold color borders, and use #00ddff for the cyan background, for consistency's sake. Use #ff000d for the red stripes in the console upgrade backgrounds.
//fame upgrades will add CPS onto controller clicks and multiply cps by a SMOL amount.
