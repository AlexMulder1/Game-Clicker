# Game-Clicker
So, I know that my group of original playtesters is probably confused by why their progress got wiped in-game.
Well, it's because I actually moved the source code of the original project from Pastebin over to Github because of a major pop-up/redirect issue.
While it's a major inconvenience for you, the player, it should be the last time something like this occurs again & I'll be able to update the game more frequently.
Now, let's move onto the actual README. (This will be changed to CHANGELOGS later down the line.)

Welcome to Game Clicker! It's a passion project made by the one & only Alexandrox and it's a fun clicker with a ton of things to do and will (inconsistently) be updated in the future! Enjoy the game.
