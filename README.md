# Game-Clicker
So, I know that my group of original playtesters is probably confused by why their progress got wiped in the new game link.
Well, it's because I actually moved the source code of the original project from Pastebin over to Github because of a major pop-up/redirect issue.
While it's a major inconvenience for you, the player, it should be the last time something like this occurs again & I'll be able to update the game more frequently.
Now, let's move onto the actual README. (This will be changed to CHANGELOGS later down the line.)

Welcome to Game Clicker! It's a passion project made by the one & only Alexandrox and it's a fun clicker with a ton of things to do and will (inconsistently) be updated in the future! Enjoy the game.
Also, there's multiple builds depending on what you want to play! (for the love of spoiler jesus don't play the dev build, it's really messy, sloppy, & gets changed constantly.) There's two builds as of now: The main build & the nostalgia build. The main build is the current version and the nostalgia build was the earliest version of Game Clicker, so play it if you want to see how the game evolved.

Version 0.91 Changelogs (CURRENT VERSION)
- Added the Hacker storyline.
- Added Virus bugs which give a special currency & progress the Hacker storyline when clicked.
- Added Antivirus fragments which progress the Hacker storyline & are used to purchase a special upgrade.
- Nerfed the inflation rate of all consoles, specifically the Potato PC's inflation rate.
- Changed the unlock conditions for the Great Beginnings achievement.
- Added unlock criteria for the Color Enhancement, Color the Console!, & New GPU upgrades.

- Added a new Arcade Machine console as part of the tutorial, as well as a corresponding upgrade.


Upcoming Updates (√ means they've been added/patched in the dev build & are coming next update.)
